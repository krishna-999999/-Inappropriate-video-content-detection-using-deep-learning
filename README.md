# -Inappropriate-video-content-detection-using-deep-learning
This project proposes a deep learning-based framework for real-time video content filtering, using EfficientNet-B7 CNN to extract features and a BiLSTM network for multiclass video classification. An attention mechanism is added to improve video representation and enhance content filtering accuracy.
